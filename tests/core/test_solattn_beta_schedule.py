"""Tests for --solattn_beta_schedule, the per-step Sol-Attn routing threshold.

One beta for a whole run assumes every denoising step is equally approximable, and measurement on
Wan 2.2 says it is not: at a matched selected-block density of about 0.44, one attention call's
relative error against exact bf16 is 0.100 at step 0, 0.157 at step 20 and 0.172 at step 39, while
a fixed beta drifts slightly sparser across that range. These pin down the plumbing that lets a
run spend its density unevenly: the spec parses to one beta per step, the step counter walks it,
and the Sol backends read the step's value rather than the flag.
