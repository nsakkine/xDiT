"""AITER Sol-Attn: what the backends promise before any kernel runs.

Sol-Attn (arXiv 2607.24027) routes for itself rather than through a Sparge
block mask, so what reaches the kernel is the call's own tensors plus the
attention_kwargs a model publishes. These pin that hand-off, and the calls the
backends refuse. The kernel itself is covered in
tests/integration/accelerator/core/test_aiter_sol_attn.py.
