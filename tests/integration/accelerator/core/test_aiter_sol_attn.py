"""The AITER Sol-Attn backends on the device.

Sol-Attn (arXiv 2607.24027) runs an AITER MHA v4 mode-2 row over the KV blocks its routing selects
and recovers the rest from pooled per-block K/V under the same online softmax, so a dropped block
costs its higher-order terms rather than all of its mass.

Nine rows are built, differing only in how Q/K/V are quantized: bf16, bf16fp8, fp8, i8fp8 and
mxfp8, and the four MX-V rows f8f6, f6f6, f6f4 and mxfp4 on gfx950's FP6-P kernels. Where a test is
about the mechanism rather than one row's precision it is parametrized over all of them, because
the rows reach the kernel by different routes: MXFP8 has no raw entry point, and the block-scaled
rows pool in dequantized space and hand the kernel a pooled scale of their own.

The CPU-side contract -- what the backends refuse, and what reaches sol_attn_bhsd -- is in
tests/unit/core/test_aiter_sol_contracts.py.

    Independent Gaussian noise is the wrong input for judging any block-sparse kernel: attention

    anything, and the measured gap to dense says more about the data than the kernel. Here the keys
    sit in contiguous per-block clusters and each query tile targets one of them, so there really is
    a block to find.

    sharpness sets cluster separation relative to the noise, and 2.0 is deliberate. Push it higher

    cluster is how wide one group of related tokens is, and it defaults to the default kernel's KV
