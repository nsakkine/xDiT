    the same everywhere, which is only right if every denoising step is equally approximable.

    20 and 0.172 at step 39, while a fixed beta drifts slightly SPARSER over the same range. The
    steps that approximate worst are being given the least help.

    Which end of the run deserves the density is not settled by that, though, and cannot be: an

        Parse a schedule spec into one beta per DENOISING STEP, held across that step's forwards.

        "first:last" ramps linearly from first at step 0 to last at the final step, which is the
        shape worth trying first and unreasonable to write out by hand for a 40-step run.
        "b0,b1,..." lists every step explicitly, for any shape that is not a ramp; its length must
        be total_steps, because a list that silently stopped short would leave the rest of the run
        on a beta nobody chose.

        forwards_per_step is how many transformer forwards one denoising step costs -- 2 under
        classifier-free guidance, one for the conditional branch and one for the unconditional.
        The step counter advances on each forward, so each beta is repeated that many times, which
        is what makes a step's two branches share one. Interpolating over forwards instead would
        put the two branches one increment apart, and not symmetrically: on an ascending ramp the
        conditional branch would take the lower beta at every step of the run, so it would be
        routed more exactly than the unconditional one throughout, and guidance subtracts them --
        it does not average the bias away. Measured on a real Wan 2.2 step, one increment of a
        -0.5:0.0 ramp moves selected-block density 0.44% and flips 0.29% of routing decisions,
        against the 39.6% that differ between the branches anyway because their operands differ.
        So this is a correctness fix with a small effect, not a quality fix.

        The hybrid attention and GEMM schedules arrive at the same place from the other direction:
        they multiply their high-precision step COUNT by the same factor, which makes them
